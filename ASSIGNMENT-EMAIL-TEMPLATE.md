Hello _______

Congratulations!

You have passed the first stage of the interview process at Cognizant.

I have a technical Java exercise assignment for you to complete at home for the next stage.

This task is written in Java JDK 11, and you will need Gradle 7 or better installed on your home/personal machine. 
This programming task should take between 1 or 2 hours.

Take your time and make sure your work is acceptable. 
 
Please send the completed ZIP / JAR file back to me or point to your Drive or cloud share so that I can download it. 
 
I will review your solution and if it passes, we will set up a second interview to discuss.

Good luck!
